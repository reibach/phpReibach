======
UPDATE
======

On start page please click on 'Update' ( left side down )
You will be redirected to the Update page. Now click on 'Update Login'

If you have changed the value of '$pschluessel' ( 1.6 Test3.01 ) in 'phprechnung.inc.php'
and have inserted them into '$pkeyOld' ( 1.6.4 ), please insert the same value from
'$pkeyOld' ( 1.6.4 ) into '$pkey' ( 1.6.4 ).

If your value of '$pschluessel' ( 1.6 Test3.01 ) was not changed, so there are no more
changes todo in 'phprechnung.inc.php'. From this point '$pkeyOld' ( 1.6.4 ) is not
needed anymore.

In Germany on 01.01.2007 the tax was changed from 16% to 19%.

The files 'invoiceposf.php' and 'offerposf.php' in directory 'update' was
modified so that invoices/offers created before 01.01.2007 have again the correct tax.

If you have another taxes, than you need to make the changes manually
before you start the update.

'invoiceposf.php'

if($Tax == "1" && $InvoiceDate < "2007-01-01")
{
	$Tax_Multi = "0.16000";
	$Tax_Divide = "1.16000";
	$Tax_Desc = "16.00 %";
}

'offerposf.php'

if($Tax == "1" && $OfferDate < "2007-01-01")
{
	$Tax_Multi = "0.16000";
	$Tax_Divide = "1.16000";
	$Tax_Desc = "16.00 %";
}

The same for Tax 2 if changed.

In both files please adapt $Pos_Group = "Hotel";

Of course the group must be present before
See table 'posgroup' - Position / Article - Group

Now please logout and login again as 'admin'

The password is the same as in phpRechnung 1.6 Test3.01

On start page please click again on 'Update' ( left side down )
and now on 'Update phpRechnung'.

Depend on your data this procedure can take some time.
