<b>Cash book</b><br />
<br />
The cash book shows you an overview of all revenue, expenditure and the daily inventory for the chosen time period.<br />
The opening balance is calculated based on the selected period.<br />
<br />
Example: Cash book - period: 01/01/2008 to 01/31/2008, the beginning inventory is the<br />
Sum of all cash-opening stock until 31.12.2007<br />
If no records are available prior to 01.01.2008 is beginning inventory: 0.00 appears.<br />
But this has no effect on the closing stock, this is calculated correctly.<br />
